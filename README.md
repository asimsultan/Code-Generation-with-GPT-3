# Code Generation with GPT-3

Welcome to the Code Generation with GPT-3 project! This project focuses on generating code snippets from natural language descriptions using the GPT-3 model.

## Introduction

Code generation involves creating code based on natural language descriptions. In this project, we leverage the power of GPT-3 to generate code snippets using a dataset of programming tasks and their corresponding code.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of programming tasks and their corresponding code snippets. You can create your own dataset and place it in the `data/code_generation_data.csv` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- OpenAI API
- Pandas

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt3_code_generation.git
cd gpt3_code_generation
```


#### Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

 Ensure your data includes programming tasks and their corresponding code snippets. Place these files in the data/ directory.
 The data should be in a CSV file with two columns: input_text and target_code.

 To fine-tune the GPT-3 model for code generation, run the following command:
```bash
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/code_generation_data.csv --api_key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```
 To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model, run:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/api_key.txt --data_path data/code_generation_data.csv --api_key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```
